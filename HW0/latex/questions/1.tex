\smalltitle{Question 1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item I am a first year Ph.D. student under the supervision of Michael Stumm.
  \item Currently, I'm only taking courses
  \item I am currently searching for my ideal research path 
        and computer architecture is one of the things that is a black-box
        for me, so I intend to get what does research in computer architecture really mean and 
        what is its state-of-the-art topic
  \item I still do not know yet but I am considering to stay in Academia
  \item I have taken Computer Organization and Computer Security in my bachelors. I did not pick any relevant course for architecture
        during my first term of Ph.D. so this is practically my first one in UofT.
  \item The only architecture-related course I have in this term is this coures :D
\end{enumerate}
