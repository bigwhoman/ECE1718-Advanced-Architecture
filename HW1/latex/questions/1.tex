\smalltitle{Question 1}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The key challenge is that previous cache side-channel attacks relied on 
    L1 cache which is practically small to probe and also infeaseble due to each core having its own 
    distinguished L1 cache in an environment like the cloud but the last level cache is 
    shared across all cores but it is slower in terms of access time which make previous approaches ineffective.\\
    The goal is to actually develop an effective side-channel attack across virtual machines on the cloud which relies on the shared last level cache between 
    these virtual machines regardless of special conditions like shared memory or VMM level vulnerabilities.

    \item Acording to the \textbf{CEASER} paper: \begin{quote}
        the group of lines that
map to the same set of the cache and can cause an eviction is
called an Eviction Set
    \end{quote}
    This basically means that eviction set is the collection of memory segments that when brought to the cache, would 
    replace a certain line and throw out whatever is in that line (flush that line of cache)
\end{enumerate}
