\smalltitle{Question 2}
\begin{enumerate}
    

    \item Gadget is basically a piece of code which is used in attacks. This piece of code is available in the memory of the victim and is usually found in shared libraries or victim's own codes which the attacker would need to find its sequences. One example is an attack called ROP(return oriented programming). Like look at the piece of code bellow : 
\begin{lstlisting}
add $a1, $a1, 1 
ret
\end{lstlisting}
this is a very simple piece of assembly which could be found in almost every program but we could use this as a tool and having enough of these and 
having control over the stack means that the attacker could basically execute their code in the victim's memory.

\item a sample of a gadget which spectre mentions is as below : 
\begin{lstlisting}
adc edi,dword ptr [ebx+edx+13BE13BDh]
adc dl,byte ptr [edi]    
\end{lstlisting}
The found this gadget on both windows 8 and windows 10 in ntdll.dll where if the attacker controls ebx and edi registers, 
it would allow the attacker to read the victim's memory
